				Hi, I'm Josh - a full-stack software engineer living in Berlin (originally from Canberra, Australia). I've worked as a software engineer for over 10 years, with a broad range of experience from web development and native apps, to backend and system languages like C++ and Go. I'm also a long-time linux and open-source enthusiast.

				<p>
					One of my tasks at KIWI was developing an overhauled version of their web-based portal for housing companies, covering back-end work (Python, Flask), database refactoring (PostgreSQL), front-end design and implementation (ES6 Javascript, Backbone, Foundation CSS), build system re-tooling (NodeJS, Gulp), and deployment (Kubernetes).

					Later I took on a new role as primary web developer after showing initiative by producing browser-based performance analysis tooling. Went on to develop a company-wide framework for service control utilizing websocket-based RPC (WAMP) and reactor-based networking (Twisted).
