        Hi, I'm Josh - a full-stack software developer living in Berlin (originally from Canberra, Australia). I've worked as a developer for over 10 years, with a broad range of experience from web development and native apps, to backend and system languages like C++ and Go. I'm also a long-time linux and open-source enthusiast.

        <p>
          My current position as full-stack software developer at colorfy GmbH covers a wide-range of domains and technologies, appiled to fast-paced agency projects. This includes back-end development, cloud operations, front-end UI development and occasionally embedded software development.

        </ul>
        <p>
          I worked briefly at flowkey GmbH, completing several projects for their piano learning web-app such as the implementation of their 'Netflix' style redesign and a specialized layout algorithm for musical note name internationalization. A variety of tools and technologies were covered, such as GraphQL/Apollo, React, MongoDB, Swift and Android debugging.

          <li>Python</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          One of my tasks at KIWI was developing an overhauled version of their web-based portal for housing companies, covering back-end work (Python, Flask), database refactoring (PostgreSQL), front-end design and implementation (ES6 Javascript, Backbone, Foundation CSS), build system re-tooling (NodeJS, Gulp), and deployment (Kubernetes).
        </p>
        <p>
          My work at KIWI was often truly full-stack, with tasks requiring me to flash hardware to test new firmware, delve into dense SQL queries, all the way up to UI-design and user-experience considerations; even some graphic-design.

        </ul>
        <p>
          At Mediaware I worked on high-performance video processing for broadcast television. It was a unique challenge to meet hard real-time requirements for lossless MPEG transformations. I was engaged in C++  performance analysis, debugging and feature development on a large codebase. It was a mid-sized Agile team adhering to well-defined processes for issue-tracking, continuous integration, customer feedback and development iterations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later I took on a new role as primary web developer after showing initiative by producing browser-based performance analysis tooling. Went on to develop a company-wide framework for service control utilizing websocket-based RPC (WAMP) and reactor-based networking (Twisted). Was also responsible for UI design, mockups, user-testing and producing high-quality documentation.
